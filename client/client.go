gedis client - Redis client written in Go

This package allows to create clients that can talk to servers by using the Redis protocol

Redis protocol: http://redis.io/topics/protocol

Example

    package main

    import (
    	"fmt"
    	"github.com/inkel/gedis/client"
    )

    func main() {
    	c, err := client.Dial("tcp", "localhost:6379")
    	if err != nil {
    		panic(err)
    	}
    	defer c.Close()

    	f := func(args ...string) {
    		fmt.Printf("> %s", args[0])
    		for _, arg := range args[1:] {
    			fmt.Printf(" %q", arg)
    		}
    		fmt.Println()

    		// Send to command to Redis server
    		res, err := c.Send(args...)
    		if err != nil {
    			panic(err)
    		}

    		fmt.Printf("< %#v\n\n", res)
    	}

    	f("PING")

    	f("SET", "lorem", "ipsum")

    	f("INCR", "counter")

    	f("HMSET", "hash", "field1", "lorem", "field2", "ipsum")

    	f("HGETALL", "hash")
    }
